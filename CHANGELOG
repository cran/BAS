Changes for BAS 1.1.0   March 31, 2016
	- New! added truncated Beta-Binomial prior and truncated Poisson (works
	only with MCMC currently)
	- deprecated method = "AMCMC" and issue warning message
	Probability model
	- improved code for finding fitted values under the Median 
	- Changed S3 method for plot and image to use "bas" rather than
	'bma' to avoid name conflicts with other packages
Changes for BAS 1.09
	- added weights for linear models
	- switched LINPACK calls in bayesreg to LAPACK finally should be
	faster
	- fixed bug in intercept calculation for glms
	- fixed inclusion probabilities to be a vector in the global EB
	methods for linear models
Changes for BAS 1.08
	- added intrinsic prior for GLMs
	- fixed problems for linear models for p > n and R2 not correct
Changes for BAS 1.07
	- added phi1 function from Gordy (1998)  confluent hypergeometric
	function of two variables  also known as one of the Horn
	hypergeometric functions or Humbert's phi1
	- added Jeffrey's prior on g
	- added the general tCCH prior and special cases of the hyper-g/n.
	- TODO check shrinkage functions for all	
Changes for BAS 1.06
	- new improved Laplace approximation for hypergeometric1F1
	- added class basglm for predict
	- predict function now handles glm output
	- added dataframe option for newdata in predict.bas and predict.basglm
	- renamed coefficients in output to be 'mle' in bas.lm to be consistent across
	lm and glm versions so that predict methods can handle both
	cases.  (This may lead to errors in other external code that
	expects object$ols or object$coefficients)
	- fixed bug with initprobs that did not include an intercept for bas.lm
	
Changes for BAS 1.05
	- added thinning option for MCMC method for bas.lm
	- returned posterior expected shrinkage for bas.glm
	- added option for initprobs = "marg-eplogp" for using marginal
	SLR models to create starting probabilities or order variables
	especially for p > n case
	- added standalone function for hypergeometric1F1 using Cephes
	library and a Laplace aproximation
	-Added class "BAS" so that predict and fitted functions (S3
	methods) are not masked by functions in the BVS package: to do
	modify the rest of the S3 methods.
	
Changes for BAS 1.04

	- added bas.glm for model averaging/section using mixture of g-priors for
	GLMs.  Currently limited to Logistic Regression
	- added Poisson family for glm.fit

Changes for BAS 1.0	
	- cleaned up  MCMC method code
	
Changes for BAS 0.93

	- removed internal print statements in bayesglm.c
	- Bug fixes in AMCMC algorithm

Changes for BAS 0.92

	- fixed glm-fit.R  so that hyperparameter for BIC is numeric

Changes for BAS 0.91

	- added new AMCMC algorithm

Changes for BAS 0.91

	- bug fix in bayes.glm

CHANGES for BAS 0.90

	- added C routines for fitting glms

CHANGES for BAS 0.85

	- fixed problem with duplicate models if n.models was > 2^(p-1) by
   restricting n.models

	- save original X as part of object so that fitted.bma gives the
   correct fitted values (broken in version 0.80)
 
CHANGES for BAS 0.80

	- Added hypergeometric2F1 function that is callable by R
	- centered X's in bas.lm so that the intercept has the correct
  shrinkage
	- changed predict.bma to center newdata using the mean(X)
	- Added new Adaptive MCMC option (method = "AMCMC")  (this is not
  stable at this point)

CHANGES for BAS 0.7

	-Allowed pruning of model tree to eliminate rejected models
 
CHANGES for BAS 0.6

	- Added MCMC option to create starting values for BAS (method = "MCMC+BAS")

CHANGES for BAS 0.5

	-Cleaned up all .Call routines so that all objects are duplicated or
 allocated within code

CHANGES for BAS 0.45

	- fixed ch2inv that prevented building on Windows in bayes glm_fit

CHANGES for BAS 0.4

	- fixed fortran calls to use F77_NAME macro 
	- changed  allocation of objects for .Call to prevent some
  objects from being overwritten.  (still need to replace more)

CHANGES for BAS 0.3

	- fixed EB.global function to include prior probabilities on models
	- fixed update function 

CHANGES for BAS 0.2

	- fixed predict.bma to allow newdata to be a matrix or vector with the
  column of ones for the intercept optionally included.
	- fixed help file for predict 
	- added modelprior argument to bas.lm so that users may now use the
	beta-binomial prior distribution on model size in addition to the
	default uniform distribution
	- added functions uniform(), beta-binomial() and Bernoulli() to create
	model prior objects
	- added a vector of user specified initial probabilities as an option for
	argument initprobs in bas.lm and removed the separate argument user.prob
